# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves developing a comprehensive accessible talking clock desktop application using Toga framework for cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and web). The application will feature customizable sound packs, speech integration using user-provided ElevenLabs API keys, system notifications, and full accessibility support including screen reader compatibility. The app will provide both visual and audio time display with extensive customization options for users with different accessibility needs.
